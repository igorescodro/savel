## How to build the server

### 1. Create a configuration file with the API keys

Each service requires a set of keys in order to send requests. The keys are stored in a configuration file that is not
tracked by the version control system. The file must be created in the following path:

```
../src/main/resources/secrets.conf
```

The file must have the following structure:

```hocon
service {
    google {
        projectId = "<my-google-cloud-project-id>"
    }
}

api {
    spotify {
        clientId = "<my-client-id>"
        clientSecret = "<my-client-secret>"
    }
}
```

### 2. Build the Docker image

The project provides a Dockerfile to build the image. To build the image, run the following command:

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t igorescodro/savel:<version> --load .
```

### 3. Run the Docker image locally

To run the image locally, a Google Cloud Default Credential is required. To generate this file locally, run the
following command:

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
```

After the login, the file `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` will be created. To run the image, run
the following command:

```shell
docker run -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/application_default_credentials.json \
    -v ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/app/application_default_credentials.json \
    -p 8080:8080 --platform linux/amd64 igorescodro/savel:<version>
```
